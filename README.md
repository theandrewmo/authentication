# Feedback App

This is a simple application that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their feedback. Once logged in, users can create new feedback, edit their own feedback, delete their own feedback, and view a list of all feedback they have given. All routes requiring user authentication are protected to ensure that users can only manage their own feedback.

## Technologies Used

This application was built using the following technologies:
- Python
- SQLAlchemy

## Authentication

All routes requiring user authentication are protected to ensure that only authenticated users can access them. In addition, routes that require a user to manage their own feedback (such as editing or deleting their own feedback) are further protected to ensure that users can only manage their own feedback and not that of others.

## Database

This application uses POSTGRESQL to store user data and feedback. The user model has the following schema:
```
{
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  }
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  }
  first_name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  }
  last_name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  }
}
```
The feedback model has the following schema:
```
{
  id: {
    type: Integer,
    required: true
  }
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  username: {
    foreignkey: users.username,
    required: true
  }
}
```
The `username` field in the feedback model is a reference to the `User` model, and is used to associate feedback with the user who created it.
